- Class: txt
  Output: "packages are extensions to R that you can download and use"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "we will be using one called tidyverse, it is technically a 
  collection of packages"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "tiyverse contains readr, dplyr, and ggplot2 but you dont need to
  memorize each individual package but it can be helpful when Googling"

- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: "lets install the tidyverse package"
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages("tidyverse")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'install.packages("tidyverse")')

  CorrectAnswer: library(tidyverse)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "library(tidyverse)")
  Hint: "the function to load a library is library()"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you only need to install the package once but you will need to load it before each session"

- Class: txt
  Output: "when you install you will need quotation marks, but when you load it R already knows that tidyverse means so you don't need quotation marks"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "import the data set from last time by loading the palmerpenguins package"

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'flippers')
  Hint: "type the variable name"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "you can extract multiple columns by adding their names to the
  command, add bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm to your command above, assign it to flippers_bills"
  CorrectAnswer: flippers_bills <- select(penguins, flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = " flippers_bills <- select(penguins, flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)")

  Hint: "print it!"

- Class: txt
  Output: "what about rows?"
  
- Class: txt 
  Output: "for rows we use the filter() function which accepts many 
  logical/relational operations as conditions"

- Class: txt
  Output: "the format is typically, variable <- filter(df_name, condition),
  where the condition can be anything like sex == 'female', or flipper_length_mm > 150.0"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "keep only penguins where species is 'Adelie' from
  penguins, assign to adelies_only"
  CorrectAnswer: adelies_only <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'adelies_only <- filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")')
  Hint: "the condition for this would be that species == 'Adelie'"
  
- Class: cmd_question

  year column and assign it to after_2008"
  CorrectAnswer: after_2008 <- filter(penguins, year > 2008)

  Hint: "if they are recorded after 2008, is year greater than or less than 2008?"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "like columns, you can combine conditions, keep only normal samples 
  (species == 'Chinstrap') AND the penguin is recorded after 2008,
  assign it to chinstrap_after_2008"
  CorrectAnswer: chinstrap_after_2008 <- filter(penguins, (species == 'Chinstrap') & (year > 2008))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr  = "chinstrap_after_2008 <- filter(penguins, (species == 'Chinstrap') & (year > 2008))")
  Hint: "use & to combine the conditions, enclose each condition in a ()"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: 'there are a few ways to accomplish the same thing in R'

- Class: txt
  Output: "you can use intermediate objects to do things in multiple steps, or 
  you can combine them into one nested function"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets first only look at penguins on Dream island, filter these rows using the column island and assign it to dream_island"
  CorrectAnswer: dream_island <- filter(penguins, island == 'Dream')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dream_island <- filter(penguins, island == 'Dream')" )
  Hint: "island should equal 'Dream'"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now select only species, sex, and year columns from dream_island, assign it to dream_island_no_measurements"
  CorrectAnswer: dream_island_no_measurements <- select(dream_island, species, sex, year)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = " dream_island_no_measurements <- select(dream_island, species, sex, year)" )
  Hint: "remember you can just list out column names when using select()"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "this is one way to get this subset, but you can also combine it into one nested function"

- Class: txt
  Output: "to nest these function together, stare with the outer function, what happens last"

- Class: txt
  Output: "in this case, you want R to select columns, and when you tell R which 
  data frame to select columns from you enter the filter function to filter out 
  the rows you want"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "nest the functions above and assign it to race_stage2"
  CorrectAnswer: dream_island_no_measurement2 <- select(filter(penguins, island == 'Dream'), species, sex, year)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = " dream_island_no_measurement2 <- select(filter(penguins, island == 'Dream'), species, sex, year)")
  Hint: "take the select command from above, replace dream_island with your filter function"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets compare the two subsets, print dream_island_no_measurement"
  CorrectAnswer: dream_island_no_measurement
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dream_island_no_measurement")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "print dream_island_no_measurement2"
  CorrectAnswer: dream_island_no_measurement2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dream_island_no_measurement2")

  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: compare dream_island_no_measurement and dream_island_no_measurement2, do they look the same or different?
  AnswerChoices: same;different
  CorrectAnswer: same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "same")

- Class: txt
  Output: "both ways get you the same output! there are many ways to get the same thing R"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "nested functions require less actual code but can be harder to format/test"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "there's not right or wrong way to do it, go with your preference"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "great work with the tidyverse lesson!"
